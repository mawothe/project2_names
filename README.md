Project 2 for Boot Camp - Name Popularity

The following project analyzes the frequency a name appeared on the Social Security website dataset. 

First, the names were cleaned and the years shortened to the last 50 years. Then the names were split based on reported gender. 

After the data clean up, the dataset is then converted into a sqlite database file that is accessed FLASK APP using an app.py file that does two things: first, it pulls the names from the database file and second, it runs the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files which show the results on an interactive bubble chart.
